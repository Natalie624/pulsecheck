/* This is optional scaffolding for a mid-layer abstraction. 
* Since we’re not doing anything complex yet (agents, memory, chains), we don’t need to touch this file yet.
* If you want to use langchainWrapper.ts later: Move shared utilities (e.g., chaining logic or prompt builders) there
* Keep openaiProvider.ts and groqProvider.ts minimal and focused
